# NHS Commercial Pipeline Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses NHS commercial pipeline data to identify procurement trends, sourcing strategies, and category distribution. The goal is to uncover insights that support better decision-making in procurement planning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the distribution of procurement processes
- Identify the most common sourcing routes
- Analyse key service categories (CPV categories)
- Examine value band distribution
- Explore trends over time

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

### 1. Procurement Process Analysis
- Distribution of records across pipeline stages
- Identification of potential bottlenecks

### 2. Commercial Strategy Insights
- Breakdown of new vs re-procurement strategies

### 3. Sourcing Route Analysis
- Most commonly used procurement routes
- Framework vs open procedure comparison

### 4. Category Analysis
- Top CPV categories driving activity
- Identification of high-demand service areas

### 5. Value Band Distribution
- Analysis of contract value ranges
- Understanding deal size patterns

### 6. Time Trend Analysis
- Monthly trend of procurement activity
- Identification of peak periods

### 7. Stage vs Value Analysis
- Relationship between procurement stage and value band
- Insights into where high-value contracts are concentrated

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- A large proportion of records are in early pipeline stages, indicating potential delays before procurement execution
- Framework-based sourcing routes are widely used, highlighting reliance on pre-approved suppliers
- Certain categories (e.g., software and services) dominate procurement activity
- Value distribution shows concentration in mid-range bands, with fewer high-value contracts
- Procurement activity shows variation across months, suggesting seasonal or planning cycles
